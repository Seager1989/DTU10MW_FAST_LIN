# DTU10MW_FAST_LIN
# Model for OpenFAST v2.4.0
This is a repo for using the DTU10 MW model (updated to openFAST V2.4) in openFAST linearization. The aerodyn15 was created in there for adapting with the openFAST linearization requirement. A comparison is also made at the rated points for demonstrating the accuracy of the revised model preliminarily. More comparisons have to be made in the future. Also, more work will be finished based on this model.

Comparison between the Aerodyn14 and Aerodyn15 regarding three power-generation measures.
