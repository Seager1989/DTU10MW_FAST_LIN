# DTU10MW_FAST_LIN
# Model for OpenFAST v3.0.0
This is a repo for using the DTU10 MW model in openFAST linearization. The aerodyn15 was created in there for adapting with the openFAST linearization requirement. A comparison is also made at the rated points for partially demonstrating the accuracy of the revised model in OpenFAST v2.4.0. More comparisons have to be made in the future. Also, more work will be finished based on this model. The model will be updated for different versions of OpenFAST. This branch will serve as the current version.

Comparison between the Aerodyn14 and Aerodyn15 regarding three power-generation measures.
